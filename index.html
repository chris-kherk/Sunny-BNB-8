                    There are a number of reasons why we don't allow groups to host events, functions, or parties at any of our short-term holiday properties, including schoolies groups, bucks or hens groups, or any other associated celebrations. The following are the reasons why we have implemented this policy:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protecting our properties: Our properties are our prized assets, and we take great care to maintain them to a high standard. Hosting large groups of people, especially those who intend to hold events or parties, can result in damages that can be costly to repair. Moreover, the noise and disturbance caused by such events can be disruptive to other guests, potentially causing them to leave early or leave bad reviews. By not allowing such events, we protect our properties and ensure they remain in pristine condition for our guests.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring guest safety: Our top priority is the safety of our guests, and hosting large groups of people who may consume alcohol or engage in risky behavior can create an unsafe environment. We have a responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable environment for our guests, and allowing events or parties could compromise that.</li>
                    <li>Protecting the community: Our properties are located in residential areas, and allowing large groups to hold events or parties could disrupt the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. Moreover, such events can attract unwanted attention and result in disturbances, potentially leading to complaints from neighbors or even the police. By not allowing events or parties, we ensure that our properties do not become a nuisance to the community.</li>
                </ul>

                    In addition to the above reasons, we also conduct a thorough review of each group that makes a booking request to stay at our properties. We check if possible their past reviews and history to ensure that they are responsible and respectful guests who are unlikely to cause any problems. If we find that a group has a history of disruptive behavior or has left bad reviews in the past, we will refuse their booking request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also include a clear statement in each property profile and house rules that we do not accept bookings for events, functions, or parties. This ensures that guests are aware of our policy before they make a booking and helps prevent misunderstandings or disputes. This is reinforced in welcome note, pre-visit and arrival notes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When a group makes a booking request, we ask them to provide information about the purpose of their trip. If they indicate that they intend to hold an event, function, or party, we will refuse their booking. Similarly, if we become aware that a group is using our property for such purposes during their stay, we will cancel their visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We take our policy on events, functions, and parties very seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that our properties remain safe and enjoyable for all our guests. By implementing this policy and conducting thorough reviews of each group that makes a booking request, we can maintain the high standards of our properties and ensure that all our guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
